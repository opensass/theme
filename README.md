## 📜 Intro

**Theme** is a **flexible**, **declarative**, and **type-safe** theming system for Rust-based WASM frameworks like **Yew**, **Leptos**, and **Dioxus**. It provides structured and composable themes, including support for dark/light/system themes and custom color palettes with runtime composition and validation.

## 🤔 Why Use Theme?

1. **🌗 Light, Dark, and System Themes**: Built-in support for light, dark, and system-preferred themes.

1. **🎨 Custom Themes with Composition**: Define your own themes with optional inheritance from base themes.

1. **🧪 Type-Safe Color Tokens**: Validate hex codes at runtime.

1. **📦 Persistent Theme Selection**: Persist user-selected themes using `LocalStorage` or `SessionStorage`.

1. **♻️ Runtime Composition with Inheritance**: Inherit and override from base themes dynamically at runtime.

1. **🎛️ Tailwind & DaisyUI Compatible**: Use custom themes to generate CSS variables that integrate smoothly with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**.
